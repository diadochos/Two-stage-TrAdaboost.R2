- Added LOOCV option to `fold`.

# Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 algorithm from Pardoe's paper "Boosting for Regression Transfer (ICML 2010)"

## Description

* This is a boosting based transfer learning algorithm for regression tasks (TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2) that is proposed by Pardoe et al. in paper "Boosting for Regression Transfer (ICML 2010)".
* The program `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2` contains two main classes that are written in `scikit-learn` style and the structure is as follows: <br />
>Stage2_TrAdaBoostR2 <br />
>>|`__init__`<br />
>>|`fit` <br />
>>|`_stage2_adaboostR2`<br />
>>|`predict` <br />

>TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2
>>|`__init__`<br />
>>|`fit`<br />
>>|`_twostage_adaboostR2`<br />
>>|`_beta_binary_search`<br />
>>|`predict`

* The first class `Stage2_TrAdaBoostR2` is a revised version of `AdaBoostRegressor` in `sklearn` package with the revision that the weights of certain data (source data) are never modified as discussed in Pardoe's paper. This class serves as the second stage of the Two-Stage TrAdaBoost.R2 algorithm.
* The second class `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2` is the main class that implements the whole two stages of the transfer learning algorithm.
* Since the code is written in `sklearn` style, it is adaptable to any regressors in the `sklearn` packages, e.g., DecisionTreeRegressor.

## Usage
* `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2`<br />
   Specify the settings of the algorithm including {base_estimator, sample_size, n_estimators, steps, fold, learning_rate, loss, random_state}. Some of these settings are the same with `AdaBoostRegressor` in `sklearn` package. The following settings are unique to the `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2`:
   1. **sample_size** is a size two list of the sample size of the source data and target data, e.g., [100, 10].
   2. **steps** is the number of iteration steps *S* in Pardoe's paper.
   3. **fold** controls the number of fold (*F*) for cross-validation in Pardoe's paper.

*  `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2.fit` <br />
   The inputs of the `fit` function include {X, y, sample_weight}
   1. **X** is the training input array including both source data and target data, **X** = [**X_source**, **X_target**] with shape = [**sample_size**[0]+**sample_size**[1], n_features].
   2. **y** is the training output array including both source data and target data, **y** = [**y_source**, **y_target**] with shape = [**sample_size**[0]+**sample_size**[1]].
   3. **sample_weight** (optional) is the initial sample weight specified for the training data. If None, it will be set to the default equal weights.

* `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2.predict` <br />
Predicting function for the predictions of test input area **X_test**.

* Simply import `TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2`, and it is ready to use (refer to 'example1.py').

## Notes
* The algorithm requires Python 3 and was tested under Python 3.6.3.
* Download all the files in the same folder, and an example is given by 'example1.py'.
